# Screamer Alliance WFC Website
This is the official website for Screamer Alliance Women's Football Club, built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme. The site is live at [https://abbieduan87.github.io/screamer-alliance-wfc/](https://abbieduan87.github.io/screamer-alliance-wfc/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Project Structure
- **Hugo:** A fast and flexible static site generator.
- **Blowfish Theme:** A clean and minimalist theme for Hugo.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for customizing styles.
